            <h5>The vision of FunOlympic 2024</h5>
            <p>
              FunOlympic 2024 will see a new vision of Olympism in action,
              delivered in a unique spirit of international celebration.
              <br /> We will offer one of the world’s most inspirational cities
              as a memorable stage for the athletes – and a truly global
              platform to promote them, and their incredible stories.
            </p>
            <p>
              And we will partner with the entire Olympic family to demonstrate
              that, more than ever after an extremely challenging period, sport
              has a unique power to help create a better world. <br /> Our plan
              features 95 percent existing or temporary venues, and every single
              one has a clear, defined legacy aligned with the city’s long-term
              development plans.
              <br /> The sporting celebration will flow along the Seine, from
              the new Olympic Village, just 15 minutes from Paris city centre,
              to such city centre landmarks as the Eiffel Tower and the Grand
              Palais.
            </p>
            <p>
              FunOlympic has welcomed people from all over the world – including
              the founding fathers of the Olympic Movement – for hundreds of
              years, to collaborate and inspire each other; to shape ideas and
              forge the future. <br /> In 2024, we will stage magnificent and
              meaningful Games that will set a new milestone in sporting
              history, in the city where Pierre de Coubertin first imagined the
              potential of a world united by sport.
